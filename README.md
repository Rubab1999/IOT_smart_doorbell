## Smart Doorbell Project by : Dareen Khair, Ruba Baba & Majed Gantous.
The Smart Doorbell is a modern IoT solution that enhances home security and convenience. It combines hardware components with a mobile application to provide real-time monitoring and control of your doorbell system.


#### On visitor's side:
you press the button to ring the bell and let the house owner know you are here, the doorbell takes a picture of you and send your request to owner with the picture, then you get an answer (accept/deny/auto deny) with a message from owner (text message, this is optional, owner can decide not to send a message so you will get access/deny only).
#### On house owner's side:
you have a mobile application for monitoring the doorbell, doorbell account.
* when someone rings the bell, you get a notification, when you enter the app, you see the visitors request with an image of the visitor. you then can choose to give him access/or deny, with option to add a message to the visitor, if 1 minute passes and you didnt give any answer, the app gives automatic deny answer.
* The doorbell also has a password, that you can access/update from app, with this password you can enter the house (enter password to the doorbell and if the password is correct it will give you access), if you enter the password incorrectly 3 times, the doorbell wont let you enter a password again,doorbell in this case handles only visitors.  enable password again from the app!, You can also see a log of visitors from all times, and upload a message for visitors.
